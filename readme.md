# Image Sorter

A faster personal tool to sort images. This is because it's a pain to make sense of finder's small thumbnails, 
as well as it being easy to lose your selection by misclicking. 

This was slightly modified from [Image Viewer](https://github.com/Moebytes/Image-Viewer)

Set the environmental variable FOLDER to the base folder containing folders of images you want to sort.

Instructions to start: \
`npm install` (only run the first time) \
`npm start`
